Now we are moving into network investigation “capture.pcapng” file. During investiagtion of powershell.json file we know the attacker ip is  167.71.211.113. sort it by length 

<img width="960" height="406" alt="Screenshot 2026-01-12 091504" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/27dfc239-d542-4bef-a7aa-bd89a5d222ae" />

5.What is the credit card number stored inside the exfiltrated file?

```json
Hint
Retrieve the exfiltrated file first using Tshark and focus on 
the query type used shown in the PowerShell logs.
```

We use Tshark tool and filter it → tshark -r capture.pcapng -n -T fields -e dns.qry.name | grep “bpakcaging.xyz” | cut -f 1 -d “.” | uniq -c . or tshark -r capture.pcapng -n -T fields -e dns.qry.name
