# Phishing-Led Memory Forensics Investigation
## Boogeyman CTF

## TryHackme (Challenge)

### Tools Used: Volatility, Olevba

### Scenario

After recovering from a previous Boogeyman attack, **Quick Logistics LLC** strengthened its security defenses. Despite these improvements, the **Boogeyman threat group** launched a new phishing campaign using updated tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs). A phishing email was reported by an employee, and shortly after, suspicious behavior was observed on the victim’s workstation. A memory dump of the system was captured for further forensic analysis to identify malware execution, persistence, and attacker activity.

## **Alert: Phishing Email Alert** triggered by suspicious attachment and email headers

The Targeted user is Maxine received a phishing email that compromised the workstation.

7.What is the full file path of the malicious stage 2 payload?

<img width="657" height="349" alt="Screenshot 2026-01-13 124136" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cebc200b-fdd0-4a98-8106-166e0ad7b287" />

Answer: C:\ProgramData\update.js

8.What is the PID of the process that executed the stage 2 payload?

For Knowing the PID of the process we have to analysis the file RAM memory “WKSTN-2961.raw” by using the tool Volatility. Command: vol WKSTN-2961.raw

<img width="960" height="390" alt="Screenshot 2026-01-13 125224" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/59bc7210-6145-4b11-9fd6-1dae11b2a9ea" />

We need only windows.pstree.PsTree to know the PID

Command: vol -f WKSTN-2961.raw windows.pstree.PsTree

<img width="592" height="361" alt="Screenshot 2026-01-13 125936" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cdeecb17-3bf7-4da0-bde4-600c6341ab02" />

Answer: 4260

Answer: 1124

10.What URL is used to download the malicious binary executed by the stage 2 payload?

Answer: https://files.boogeymanisback.lol/aa2a9c53cbb80416d3b47d85538d9971/update.png

11.What is the PID of the malicious process used to establish the C2 connection?

After the malicious binary downloaded, it established C2 connection so it will be next after downloaded

Answer: 6216

12.What is the full file path of the malicious process used to establish the C2 connection?

Searching the updater.exe file related words by using this command :strings WKSTN-2961.raw | grep "updater.exe”

<img width="960" height="288" alt="Screenshot 2026-01-13 133709" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3a14f5bd-051b-4a1b-9da4-1043d2dae4b9" />

Answer: C:\Windows\Tasks\updater.exe

13.What is the IP address and port of the C2 connection initiated by the malicious binary? (Format: IP address:port)

Need windows.netscan.NetScan module to view the network connection
