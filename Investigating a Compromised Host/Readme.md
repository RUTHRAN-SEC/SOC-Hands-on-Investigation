# Investigating a Compromised Host

## **Benign CTF**

## TryHackme (Challenge)

### Tools Used: Splunk

### Scenario

One of the client’s IDS indicated a potentially suspicious process execution indicating one of the hosts from the HR department was compromised. Some tools related to network information gathering / scheduled tasks were executed which confirmed the suspicion. Due to limited resources, we could only pull the process execution logs with Event ID: 4688 and ingested them into Splunk with the index **win_eventlogs** for further investigation.

## Alert: Suspicious Process Execution Detected

### About the Network Information

```json
The network is divided into three logical segments. It will help in the investigation.

### Challenge questions

4.Which user from the HR department executed a system process (LOLBIN) to download a payload from a file-sharing host.

```json
Hint:
Explore lolbas-project.github.io/ to find binaries used to download payloads

We know that the imposter is within the HR department so we only filter form that only.

index=win_eventlogs HostName=”*HR*” | top limit=50 CommandLine , In second page we see certutil command that helps to download files in windows.
