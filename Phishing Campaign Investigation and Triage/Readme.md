# Phishing Campaign Investigation and Triage

## **Phishing Analysis 2**

## Blue Team lab Online

### Tools Used: Text Editor, Thunderbird

### Scenario

You are working as a SOC Analyst in a newly established Security Operations Center that is still in the process of building its detection and response capabilities. As part of threat intelligence gathering and SOC maturity improvement, you are tasked with reviewing a threat intelligence report released in 2022.

The objective is to analyze the report, identify relevant threat trends, attacker tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs), and suggest actionable outcomes that can be implemented within the SOC. These outcomes may include improvements to detection rules, monitoring use cases, incident response playbooks, and analyst awareness to better prepare the SOC against emerging threats.
