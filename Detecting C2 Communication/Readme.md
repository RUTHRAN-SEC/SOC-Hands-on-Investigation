## TryHackme (Challenge)

### Tool Used: Elastic

### Scenario

During normal SOC monitoring, Analyst **John** observed an alert on an IDS solution indicating a potential C2 communication from a user **Browne** from the HR department. A suspicious file was accessed containing a malicious pattern THM:{  }. A week-long HTTP connection logs have been pulled to investigate.
